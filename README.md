====


This is a Fork of the original PureEntities plugin which has become inactive; RevivalPMMP is now updating and maintaining it, so  you can have smart mobs on your server! (At least until Pocketmine implements them)

PureEntitiesX does not officially provide compatibility with PocketMine-MP _Third Party_ builds.
Compatibility may be found with some, but do not expect anything.

## Contributing/Issues:

We are pretty relaxed about our issues. As long as they are descriptive and contain readable english, we may allow them to be referenced for bug fixes. For Pull Requests, please make sure that they actually fix or add something and that you ***test it*** before you PR. If the PR is buggy, we will request changes or close it. Please use our [Forums](http://revivalpmmpforums.gq) for setup questions, feature requests, and anything that isn't an Issue. ***Please note that issues that don't comply with our rules will be closed***

## Usage:

You are welcome to use actual data from PureEntitiesX (Mob Widths, Heights, Item Drops), but please don't copy our AI and claim it as your own. We give full credit to @milk0417 to starting the AI, but we have made numerous changes since then, so we ask you kindly _*Not to Copy our code (Unless you are forking and PR-ing, of course)*_

## Features:

- Mobs have proper AI and tracking
- Mobs naturally spawn within the proper areas
- Mobs now drop their proper items with their proper rates
- Server setting implimentations
- Others Coming soon!

You can download the latest version of the plugin phar from our releases [here](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/releases/latest). Just drop it into your plugins folder and run your server!
